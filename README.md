# Tic-Tac-Toe with Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning

![Tic-Tac-Toe Demo](demo.gif)

## Overview

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Python's Tkinter library. The game features an AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make optimal moves.

## Features

- A graphical user interface for playing Tic-Tac-Toe against the computer.
- An AI opponent that uses the minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to make challenging moves.
- A user-friendly interface that allows players to make their moves by clicking on the grid.
- Win detection and draw detection to announce the winner or a draw when the game ends.
- A demo GIF showing the gameplay.

## Prerequisites

Before running the game, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x: You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

## Customization
You can easily customize the game by modifying the code. For example, you can change the game's appearance, such as the grid size or the symbols used. You can also tweak the AI's difficulty by adjusting the depth of the minimax algorithm.
